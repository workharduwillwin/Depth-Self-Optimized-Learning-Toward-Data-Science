# Depth-Self-Optimized-Learning-Toward-Data-Science
We proposed a two-stage model called Depth Self-Optimized Learning(DSOL). DSOL is used to realize ANN depth self-configuration, self-optimization. 
# Background
A large number of studies have shown that the performance of ANN is closely related to its depth and width. And, according to the no free lunch(NFL) theorem, no model could fit all kinds of datasets. However, If a model could optimized itself according to specific datasets, maybe it can be adapted to a variety of different datasets. Based on those ideas mentioned above, we decide to develop a model could realize ANN depth self-optimized, self-configuration so as to be able to approximate on more different kinds of datasets.
